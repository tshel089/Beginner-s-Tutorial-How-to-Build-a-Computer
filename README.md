<p><strong>Data Storage (HDD and SSD)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hard Disk Drive (HDD)</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.Rfjrb42COY9WlSd7J2l4xAHaHa?w=189&amp;h=189&amp;c=7&amp;r=0&amp;o=5&amp;dpr=1.3&amp;pid=1.7" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<p>A data storage device that uses mechanical, magnetic disks to store and retrieve digital information.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Cost-Effective</strong>: HDDs are generally cheaper than Solid State Drives (SSDs) on a per-gigabyte basis, making them more affordable for large storage capacities.</li>
<li><strong>Widely Available</strong>: HDDs are common and easy to find in a variety of form factors and storage capacities.</li>
<li><strong>High Storage Capacity</strong>: HDDs are available in very large storage sizes (several terabytes), making them ideal for bulk storage, such as for media files, backups, or archiving.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Mechanical Parts</strong>: The presence of moving parts makes HDDs more prone to physical damage from drops, impacts, or wear over time, leading to potential failure.</li>
<li><strong>Noise and Heat</strong>: The spinning disks and moving parts in HDDs can generate noise and heat, making them less ideal for quiet or compact systems.</li>
<li><strong>Slower Speed</strong>: HDDs are much slower than SSDs in terms of data read/write speeds due to their mechanical components (spinning disks and moving read/write heads).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Solid State Drive (SSD)</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.5cfSutZqyaxAuqEq2j6V5wHaE8?w=251&amp;h=180&amp;c=7&amp;r=0&amp;o=5&amp;dpr=1.3&amp;pid=1.7" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<p>A type of data storage device that uses flash memory to store data.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Faster Speed</strong>: SSDs provide significantly faster read and write speeds compared to HDDs. This results in quicker boot times, faster file transfers, and better overall system performance.</li>
<li><strong>Lower Power Consumption</strong>: SSDs consume less power than HDDs, making them more energy-efficient, which is particularly beneficial for laptops and portable devices where battery life is crucial.</li>
<li><strong>Durability</strong>: Since SSDs have no moving parts, they are more durable and resistant to physical damage, such as drops or shocks, compared to HDDs.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Higher Cost</strong>: SSDs are more expensive than HDDs, especially at higher storage capacities, making them less cost-effective for users who need a lot of storage.</li>
<li><strong>Lower Storage Capacity (for the price)</strong>: While SSDs are available in large sizes, they are generally more expensive per gigabyte compared to HDDs, so users may need to spend more for the same storage capacity.</li>
<li><strong>Data Recovery Challenges</strong>: When SSDs fail, data recovery can be more difficult and expensive compared to HDDs, due to their complex architecture and the nature of flash memory.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.noGXfks77lqbDhS_t7QewgHaFl?w=237&amp;h=180&amp;c=7&amp;r=0&amp;o=5&amp;dpr=1.3&amp;pid=1.7" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<p>A specialized processor designed to handle and accelerate graphics rendering and visual computing tasks.</p>
<p><strong>Cooling System (Airflow and Liquid)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Airflow</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.mlmTEXjelFjv2NqRSG3VpwHaHY?w=192&amp;h=191&amp;c=7&amp;r=0&amp;o=5&amp;dpr=1.3&amp;pid=1.7" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<p>A cooling method that relies on the movement of air to dissipate heat from internal components like the CPU, GPU, and storage devices.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Cost-Effective</strong>: Airflow cooling systems are typically cheaper than liquid cooling solutions, as they mainly rely on fans and heat sinks.</li>
<li><strong>Reliable</strong>: Air cooling systems are widely used and generally offer reliable cooling performance for most standard computing needs.</li>
<li><strong>Simple Setup</strong>: Air cooling is easier to install and maintain, with fewer components and less complexity compared to liquid cooling systems.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Less Efficient</strong>: Air cooling is generally less efficient at dissipating heat compared to liquid cooling, especially for high-performance or overclocked systems.</li>
<li><strong>Louder</strong>: Airflow cooling often requires multiple fans, which can generate more noise, especially at higher speeds, compared to liquid cooling systems that may be quieter.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Cooling Capacity</strong>: Air cooling might struggle to keep temperatures low in systems with very powerful components (like high-end GPUs or overclocked CPUs), leading to potential thermal throttling.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Liquid</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.SEKNv7Wy_6YLEL8L4XiDiAHaGL?w=225&amp;h=187&amp;c=7&amp;r=0&amp;o=5&amp;dpr=1.3&amp;pid=1.7" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<p>A method of heat dissipation that uses a liquid coolant to absorb and transfer heat away from components like the CPU or GPU.<br>
<strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Superior Cooling Efficiency</strong>: Liquid cooling is generally more efficient than air cooling, allowing it to better handle high-performance components like overclocked CPUs and GPUs, keeping temperatures lower under heavy load.</li>
<li><strong>Quieter Operation</strong>: Liquid cooling systems tend to be quieter than air cooling setups because they use fewer or slower fans, which helps reduce noise levels.</li>
<li><strong>Compact and Aesthetic</strong>: Liquid cooling solutions, especially all-in-one (AIO) units, can be more compact and offer a cleaner, more organized look. They often have visually appealing designs and can include RGB lighting.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Higher Cost</strong>: Liquid cooling solutions, especially custom loops, are typically more expensive than air cooling systems. The initial investment and potential maintenance costs can be significant.</li>
<li><strong>Complex Installation</strong>: Liquid cooling systems, particularly custom loops, can be complicated to install and require more technical know-how compared to simpler air cooling setups.</li>
<li><strong>Maintenance Required</strong>: Liquid cooling systems require more maintenance than air cooling. This includes monitoring coolant levels, cleaning radiators, and replacing coolant every couple of years to prevent buildup and degradation.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Case</strong></p>
